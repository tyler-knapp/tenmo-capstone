# tenmo-capstone

My pair partner Mana and I developed a RESTful API that replicated the peer-to-peer money transfer and banking management service Venmo.
To complete thid project we utilized SpringBoot, Tomcat, JDBC, DAOs and the MVC framework. 

This project is still under construction! I'm hoping to get all requirements done and then switching out the CLI front end
with a JS/HTML/CSS front end that uses Vue.js to give it a better user experience.
